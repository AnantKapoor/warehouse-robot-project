* A mapping from team members to roles/subsystems.
* For each subsystem where appropriate, a suite of JUnit tests which you expect the final subsystem to pass.
* A prototype implementation of each subsystem which can be run against the tests (but may fail all of them).
* One or more Git repositories which can be monitored to observe development progress.
* Ideally some demonstration of partial subsystem integration.
* Any additional documentation necessary to support your team's progress (e.g. notes on who has worked well to deadlines).
